```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Code chunk
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
load(here::here("data/lipidomics.rda"))
lipidomics %>%
  select(gender, age) %>%
  filter(age >= 25)
```

## This is poorly formatted

-   Definitely should have an empty space above this list.
-   This isn't a list, why not?

## Basic statistics

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
source(here::here("R/functions.R"))
load(here::here("data/lipidomics.rda"))
```
